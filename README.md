# Content

Design goal of the Content storage/serialization backend.

## Simple implementation of Content trait for any type
   When implementing Content for your type, you need to provide only two methods, `to_content` that takes a Read, and produces a Self, and `from_content`, an example for u8:
```rust
impl Content for u8 {
    fn to_content(&self, sink: &mut Sink) -> Result<()> {
        sink.write_all(&[*self])
    }
    fn from_content(source: &mut Source) -> Result<Self> {
        let b = &mut [0u8];
        try!(source.read_exact(b));
        Ok(b[0])
    }
}
```
## The `Backend` trait
   The backend trait makes a type act as as storage for content addressed bytestreams, be it `Vec<u8>` or `File`. But it could also be a network interface, for example.

## The type is the schema
   Things that implement Content, implicitly know how to serialize and deserialize themselves, including knowing their length. And since types can nest other Content types within themselves, you basically get the whole schema and de/serialization for free.
## Zero copy io
   When a Content is put into a store, Reads and Writes are connected directly.
